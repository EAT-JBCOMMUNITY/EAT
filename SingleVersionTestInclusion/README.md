# EAP ADDITIONAL TESTSUITE SINGLE VERSION TESTS
-----------------------------------------------

For those who would like to add a test in Eap Additional Testsuite, quickly, in the same way a common test is added in the regular-existing repositories, he/she could add the test here (SingleVersionTestInclusion directory) commenting the versions of the server he/she would like to test. Then the test will be added along with the other eap-additional-testsuite sources in order to enable multiversion testing.
